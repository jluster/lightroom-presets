## A number of Presets

These presets are technically nothing special, just my collection of boudoir and nude/kink photography starters. As always: never depend on a preset!

All Presets are made available to you by Jonas M Luster <jml@jml.is> under an IDGAFF (I don't give a flying something) license. This means you're free to do with them as you please, change them, sell them (I will ceaselessly mock and ridicule you to everyone if you do, however, including calling you names and insinuating you pleasure farm animals. By selling my Presets you explicitly agree to me doing this.)

Lightroom: Instead of installing this via right-click -> Install, you can also just move the included folder into "<Your Home>/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/Lightroom/Develop Presets". It's faster and easier.
