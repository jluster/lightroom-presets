## A number of Presets

All Presets are made available to you by Jonas M Luster <jml@jml.is> under a [Creative Commons BY-SA-NC-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. This means you're free to do with them as you please, change them, remix them, redistribute them, as long as you're a nice person and attribute me.

Lightroom: Instead of installing this via right-click -> Install, you can also just move the included folder into "<Your Home>/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/Lightroom/Develop Presets". It's faster and easier.

[Here](https://plus.google.com/+JonasLuster/posts/E8XyUXyo1BQ) is an example in the wild.
