## Hipsters

If you can't beat them (and I mean 'beat', not 'best in a sport'), join them. In that vain I have created four Lightroom 5 presets as starters for your own Hipster food, architecture, and people photo needs. Next time you want to badly be featured in Kinfolk, Gather Journal or Cereal with your organic, local, single sourced, arugula salad, you have the right preset. Or if you want a whimsy shot of your Fixie in front of a brick wall belonging to a local coffee brewer, there's a preset for that. And if you're REALLY into taking pictures of ironically tattooed men with beards - we gotcha covered.
