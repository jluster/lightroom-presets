## Photomatix HDR Pro Presets

These presets go best with my workflow and setup, five exposures -3 and -1 EV on both sides. I mainly shoot via exposure variation, not EV compensation and am aiming for realistic looks rather than the overblown "Skittles puked all over this" look that's so popular on Tumblr and Google+.
